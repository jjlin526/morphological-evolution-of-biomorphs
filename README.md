### Robotic Morphology Optimization 
- Leveraged genetic algorithms in AI to optimize the evolutionary morphology of robots for locomotion
- Utilized parallel computing to optimize lineages through hyperplane sampling, mutations and schemas
- Modeled 3D rigid-body dynamics in PyBullet and encoded biomorph phenotype DAGs as URDF files for ROS
